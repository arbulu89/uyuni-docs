= Recipe: Onboarding

{productname} is all about managing client systems.
So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients.
This recipe shows you how to set up your {productname} Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key.



== Problem

This recipe shows you how to onboard a client to your {productname} Server.

The client can be running any Linux operating system.
For a list of supported client systems, see xref:installation:client-requirements.adoc[].

This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up {productname} for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product.

This recipe shows you how to onboard a single client, for a recipe about onboarding multiple clients at the same time, see xref:FIXME[].



== Solution

When you have completed this recipe, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the {productname} {webui}.
You can then use {productname} to manage the client.



== Before you begin

Pre-requisites, assumptions, etc.


== Steps

Probably best to do this as a deflist.


== More information

Reference material, links to other docs, etc.
